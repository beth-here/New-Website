Instructions
You will conceptualize, plan, and launch a five-page (minimum) piece of Net Art with reciprocal links between the five+ pages. 
Your project must employ both HTML and CSS of your own design, and at least one image and one video. 
You will include your name in a comment at the top of each of your HTML pages. 
Your piece should be conceptually based, meaning that the idea helps drive the decisions you make as you execute the piece. 
Since this project is to be native to the Web, consider what that means to make work on the Internet and for display on the Internet in the twenty-first century.

Your piece could be a text-based narrative, a multi-page game, a formalist exercise in Post-Internet chaos, a frustration and complication of website expectations and design, an autobiographical videolog, a navigable treatise in the form of YouTube tutorials, or many other options. 
It should be more than just a “gallery,” but something that leverages interaction, navigation, and the possibilities of code and website structures.
